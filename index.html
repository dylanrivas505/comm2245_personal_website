	<p>My name is Dylan Rivas, and music has always been one of the biggest parts of my life. Although I listen to a wide range of genres, rock has always been my favorite. I was introduced to rock music when I was a kid thanks to my dad, who played all kinds of classic bands around the house and in the car. I have vivid memories of driving to soccer games with him and my brother, blasting Metallica, AC/DC, and Led Zeppelin to get us fired up before we played. Those moments made me fall in love with the genre, and ever since then, rock music has shown up in every part of my life. Because of this, one of my absolute favorite things to do is go to concerts.</p>

	<p>The first concert I ever went to was Foreigner. Even though Foreigner isn’t one of my all-time favorite bands, they still performed a lot of songs I enjoy, and it was an incredible introduction to the world of live music. The show left me excited, energized, and wanting to experience even more. I realized right away that I needed to see more of the bands I grew up listening to, especially since many of them are getting older and might not tour much longer.</p>

<p>Since that first show, I’ve seen more than 30 artists and bands live, and I’ve enjoyed every single one of them. Of course, some stood out more than others. For this personal website, I’ll be highlighting my four favorite concert experiences. Each one featured multiple artists, unforgettable performances, and moments that reminded me why live music means so much to me. I hope that by sharing these experiences, I can give others a glimpse into why these shows were so special.</p>
