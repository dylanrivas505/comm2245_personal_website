	<p>The #1 best concert I’ve ever been to was the Swedish Rock Festival. Although this was a four-day festival, it was still one event, so I am counting it as one concert. Before I even start talking about the music, I will discuss everything else. This concert took place in Sweden, in a small town on the coast called Sölvesborg. I decided to do this trip with one friend, and it was a fantastic experience. Everyone we met in Sweden was very kind, and was willing to help with anything. Language wasn’t an issue, and we were able to get everything we needed. This put us in a great place before the concerts even started.</p>

	<p>The first night of concerts was highlighted by the Nu Metal band Slipknot. Known for their amazing theatrics in their concerts, they put on a great show. The frontman, Corey Taylor, had vocals that filled the festival grounds. It was a beautiful performance, with great song performances, like ‘Sic,’ ‘Duality,' and ‘Spit It Out’. As good as Slipknot was, they weren’t even my favorite concert of the festival.</p>

	<p>The next day, the headliners were another Nu Metal band, Korn. Korn brought down the house as soon as they started playing, opening with their first hit, ‘Blind’. The bass guitar could be felt in your bones, as their hard rock style truly filled the area. A show highlighted by other hits like ‘Freak on a Leash’ and ‘Here to Stay’, Korn truly played their hearts out. In addition to the amazing music, the experience got even better, as my friend and I were on the front railing, with a perfect view of the show.</p>
	
	<p>These were the two bands that made this experience unforgettable. The other two nights were headlined by the bands Scorpions and Sabaton. These were good shows, as well as all of the other bands I saw during this festival, but Slipknot and Korn were who made it special.</p>
