	<p>The #3 best concert I’ve ever been to was The Red Hot Chili Peppers. This show was in Denver, Colorado, at the Denver Broncos stadium. I was with my brother, dad, friend, and his dad. We had floor seats, and were ready to see a band that we all loved. They had a couple openers I was unfamiliar with, but it got the energy high, ready for the main event. Then, it started storming.</p>

	<p>There was a lot of rain. There wasn’t close-enough thunder to make us go inside, but there was enough rain to delay the show. The entire stadium was antsy, waiting for the band that everyone came to see. The rain showed no end in sight, and people started to lose hope. Then, out of nowhere, the Red Hot Chili Peppers emerged, opening with one of their biggest hits, ‘Can’t Stop’.</p>

	<p>It was a shock when they came out. Everyone was soaking wet, but if anything, it made the performance better. Their star bassist, Flea, was performing at the top of his level, slapping the bass, making the entire audience feel every note. The other members, singer Anthony Kiedis, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante, also performed at the best of their abilities.</p>
	
	<p>With hit songs like ‘Snow’, ‘Under the Bridge’, and ‘Californication’, the Red Hot Chili Peppers filled the stadium with their emotion-filled rock music. The entire audience, including myself, could feel every word and note uttered in their soul. The crowd echoed the lyrics of every song back to Kiedis, and it was truly beautiful.</p>
