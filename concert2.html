	<p>The #2 best concert I’ve ever been to was Metallica. This was a two night concert, what they called a “No Repeat Weekend.” This involved two shows, in which they did not repeat a song. They performed in Phoenix, Arizona, but things didn’t go to plan.</p>

	<p>The first night, the show was fantastic. It was opened by Pantera, who is a headliner band on their own. They set Metallica up for a great show by playing their hits, like ‘Cowboys From Hell’ and ‘Walk’. It set the stage for a great night of hard rock, and the audience was ready for the main event.</p>

	<p>Metallica came out hot. They played great songs, like ‘King Nothing’ and ‘Fuel’. From the prior setlists, their show was supposed to be closed by their hit song “Master of Puppets,’ but this show ended early. It was soon found out that the lead singer, James Hetfield, came down with COVID, and they had to end the show early. Even worse, the second show was delayed until the next weekend. My father and I made the decision to travel back to Phoenix the next weekend to see them again.</p>
	
	<p>It ended up being one of the best decisions we made. That second concert, Metallica had an extra edge to them. You could tell they were playing with more emotion, and more purpose. Playing songs like ‘For Whom the Bell Tolls’ and ‘One’, the audience was rocking. Then, out of nowhere, they played the song missing from the previous set. ‘Master of Puppets’ came out of nowhere on the setlist, and it was awesome. Their whole show was a beautiful performance, capped off with their #1 hit, “Enter Sandman”. Metallica was a once in a lifetime experience, and is a show I am extremely thankful for.</p>
